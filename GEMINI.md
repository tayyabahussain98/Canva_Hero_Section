You are an expert front-end developer and UI replication specialist.

Your task:
Convert the following screenshot into pixel-perfect HTML + CSS that matches:
- exact colors
- exact gradient (purple → blue → turquoise)
- exact font weights and sizes
- exact spacing and alignment
- exact button styling
- exact nav layout
- exact heading style (large, thin font)
- exact subheading style
- exact border radius and shadows

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use HTML + CSS only (no Tailwind, no Bootstrap).
- Use internal CSS inside <style>.
- Use a Google Font that visually matches Canva’s typography (use "DM Sans" or "Poppins").
- Reproduce the exact gradient from the screenshot:
  Purple (#A855F7) → Blue (#3B82F6) → Teal (#06B6D4)
- Recreate the nav bar exactly:
  Design | Product | Plans | Business | Education | Help
- Right side:
  Sign up (purple button) + Log in (white button)
- Center hero text:
  "A new era of imagination"
- Subtext:
  "Discover a whole new world of skills and tools designed to put your imagination to work."
- Buttons must match exact look:
  - “Start designing for free” → white with shadow
  - “Explore our launches” → dark gradient

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Deliver a single HTML file.
- Include detailed comments explaining each major section.
- Do not simplify colors; match them visually to the screenshot.

Here is the screenshot you must replicate:
